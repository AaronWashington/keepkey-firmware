This directory contains an STM32 USB HID (Human Interface Device) example from
the following URL:

	http://www.keil.com/download/docs/361.asp

Keil provides a ZIP file containing source code written for their MCBSTM32
Evaluation Board, which is described here:

	http://www.keil.com/mcbstm32/

The MCBSTM32 board uses a STM32F103RB processor, which is similar to the
STM32F103ZGT6 processor on the STM3210E-EVAL board that we already have at
Carbon.

The following URL provides instructions for running the USB HID example
firmware with a Windows application provided by Keil:

	http://www.keil.com/support/man/docs/mcb2140/mcb2140_ex_usbhid_run.htm

The Windows application is apparently called HIDClient.exe. It is apparently
included in the Keil uVision distribution and may be requested from Keil
Technical Support:

	http://www.keil.com/support/

I don't know how responsive Keil will be if you're not a uVision customer.
