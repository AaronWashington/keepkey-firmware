@par Description

This directory contains a set of STM3210E-EVAL Demo binary files that should be
programmed to the STM32F10x internal FLASH using different methods:
   - In-Circuit-Programming using the embedded bootloader
   - In-System Programming tool

 + Using "In-System Programming tool"
    - Connect the board through JTAG probe to your preferred in-system programming tool
    - Use "STM3210E-EVAL_Demo_V2.1.0.hex" file to reprogram the demonstration firmware 

    Note: You can use the embedded ST-LINK/V2 HW with STM32 ST-LINK Utility software,
          available for download from www.st.com, to program your board.

 + Using Bootloader
    - Configure the board to boot from "System Memory" (boot pin BOOT0:1 / option bit BOOT1:0)
    - Use "STM3210E-EVAL_Demo_V2.1.0.hex" file with the "STM32 Flash loader demonstrator"
      software, available for download from www.st.com, to program your board.
    - Once the binary is programmed, configure boot pins in "Boot from Flash" position
      and restart the board

      For more information about the STM32F10x Bootloader, please refer to "AN2606 
      STM32 microcontroller system memory boot mode."
