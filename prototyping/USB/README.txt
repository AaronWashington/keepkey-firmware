This directory contains demonstration and/or prototyping code used to evaluate
application of the Keepkey wallet as a USB human interface device (HID).

Note: Lowell Skoog has an electronic copy of Jan Axelson's "USB Complete"
book.  The book is readable using the Adobe Digital Editions application.
Being an e-book, it is a pain in the ass to share it.
