This directory contains demonstration and/or prototyping code used to evaluate
application of the Keepkey wallet as a USB human interface device (HID).

At this point, the following directories contain stuff that I've actually been
able to use:

    STM3210E-EVAL_FW_V2.1.0
    STM32_USB-FS-Device_Lib_V4.0.0
    STM32_USB_HID_Demonstrator_V1.0.2
    STM32_USB_python_scripts

The other directories contain stuff that I thought might be useful, but it
hasn't proven so yet.  They can probably be deleted eventually:

Note: Lowell Skoog has an electronic copy of Jan Axelson's "USB Complete"
book.  The book is readable using the Adobe Digital Editions application.
Being an e-book, it is a pain in the ass to share it.
