PYUSB 0.4.2 Scripts
===================

I started working with pyusb-0.4.2 because I already had it in my Linux
environment (as I vaguely recall).

Sample scripts for pyusb-0.4.2 can be found in:
    pyusb-0.4.2.tar.gz
which was downloaded from:
    http://sourceforge.net/projects/pyusb.berlios/files/

The "usbenum.py" and "usbprint.py" examples were written for pyusb-0.4.2
The are not compatible with pyusb-1.0.0

For documentation of pyusb-0.4.2, run python and enter these commands:
>>> import usb
>>> help(usb)
